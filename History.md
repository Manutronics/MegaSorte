First this is a project that was based on another code found over the inernet and I
don't remember from where I picked the sources... A lot of codes from Qt docs, examples,
help files and many blogs where the solutions offered by members match what I needed.
Then, thank you all for sharing! Spread knowledgement is really alwesome!!!!

Well, when I supposed started this project, I had worked only with embedded programming
and, as a eletronics engineer, I was not able to know the OS fundamentals to known exactly
what to look for and where to search base material to stablish a strong 'know how'.

Many many things were studied and only one thing that I really can say for sure is: You
won't know everything about everything. I saw tons of people discording about a subject and
I lost my time only, for real, to see that both are absoluttely right.

When I was serching for an insight to make me train the skills of desktop programming I
was surrounded by coworkers whispering about one huge prize of 'Mega Sena', one of lottery
modalities here in Brazil. As soon as I listened people speaking about their 'lucky numbers'
(yeah... the Caixa Economica lottery has modalities that you need to choose among a pool
of numbers) my mind realized that using the technology (computing) could make the analisys
of the numbers more intuitive to observe some pattern, if it occurs.

My first attempt was to make an interface and show one screen that fade from one colour to
another according a slider chage was detected. But not that simple! The colour needed to
fade from green to dark red (some kind of metheorologic style) and without any library. At
first this could seem an idiot thing to program, but it brings a lot of need about
computational colour science. It was so funny!

The next thing was about to get the data to analisys. Well, as a public institution of Brazil
the Caixa Economica bank need accomplish with offer the data as a manner to... Ohh I don't
know exactly why this is obrigatory, but seems right for me. Then, those requirements made
me started to find how to do and why the things had to be as described.

Dataset downloaded! How can I use the data inside a zip compressed file? It led me to another
research. The internet had and still have a plenity of information about how to do that and,
more important, source code for virtually everything! Just to register here, was that time
I first listened about a thing called RegEx... Ohh It is so spectacular!!!! And those was
absolutely necessary to had achieve the goal! My solution looked like a monster, but worked
as a charm.

The history continue... (and that is intentional! I am still learning about version control
and code management, as well as learn about how to collaborate on another's projects on github)

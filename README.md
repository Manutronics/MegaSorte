# MegaSorte
A project that a work mate suggest me to begin to learn DB and C++.

This project was created a long time ago and had a lot of things to do to improve the user experience. The missing code comments are because this project was not meant to be 
shared, it was just amounts of code put together with knowledge intents... As soon as possible I will keep things up to date, but as I have a lot of things to publish here, 
maybe the updates to this repo will have delays.

The summary of the history of this code is into [History.md](./History.md).
